# Kaggle: Storytelling With Data

This repo includes some projects using dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), including codes, data and notes.

I create this repo to practice related skills and find it more beneficial than I thought.

# Notes

Sometimes, I am frustrated to find that many top codes in Kaggle illustrate little insights on the specific datasets. 

They do everything, such as clearing, visualization, feature engineering and prediction, etc.

BUT they seem to do nothing, because little results are interesting or meaningful enough to attract my attention.

Thus I decided to dig deeper into it and record what I have found behind these data.

This is a practice of Storytelling With Data.


# Keep in mind

"The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures."

"The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight."

"Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful."
