# Kaggle

This repo includes some projects using dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), including codes, data and notes.

I create this repo to practice related skills and find it more beneficial than I thought.

# Keep in mind

"The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures."

"The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight."

"Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful."
